# Emotion Recognition System
## Overview
This project aims to classify emotions from speech using deep learning techniques. 
The model uses audio features such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and spectrograms to predict emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and others.

##In the future, I will start working on this project again, and the project structure will be :
